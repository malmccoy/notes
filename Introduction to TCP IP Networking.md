# Introduction to TCP/IP Networking

## Quiz answers and explanations

 1. **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) and **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) are examples of TCP/IP transport layer protocols.
| TCP/IP Architecture Layer | Example Protocols        |
| :-------------            | :----------:             |
| Application               | HTTP, POP3, SMTP         |
| Network                   | TCP, UDP                 |
| Transport                 | IP, ICMP                 |
| Data Link & Physical      | Ethernet, 802.11 (Wi-Fi) |
 2. **Ethernet** and **PPP** are examples of data-link protocols.
 3. The process of HTTP asking TCP to send some data and making sure it's recieved correctly is an example of **adjacent-layer interaction**.
 4. The process of TCP on one computer marking a TCP segment as segment 1, and the receiving computer then acknoeledging the receipt of TCP segment 1 is an example of **same-layer interaction**.
 5. The process of a web server adding a TCP header to the contents of a web page, followed by adding an IP header and then adding a data-link header and trailer, is an example of **data encapsulation**.
 6. **Frame** identifies the entity created when encapsulating data inside the data-link layer headers and trailers.
 7. **Layer 2 PDU** can be used instead of the term frame.
